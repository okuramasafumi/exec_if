# ExecIf

This gem adds `exec_if` method to `Object` class.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'exec_if'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install exec_if

## Usage

```ruby
require 'exec_if'

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map do |i|
  i.exec_if(i.even?) { 'even' }
end # => [1, 'even', 3, 'even', 5]
```

It is especially useful for long method chains.

```ruby
Item.active.
  exec_if(params[:published_to].present?) { where(published_at: nil..params[:published_to]) }.
  exec_if(params[:name].present?) { where("name LIKE ?", "%#{params[:name]}%")}.
  order(published_at: :desc)
```

Condition part of `exec_if` can be one of these:

* `Proc`, which is called with self
* `Symbol`, which is the name of the message of send
* `String`, which is `eval`uated in context of self
* `Object`, which is simply used to check truthyness

See `examples` directory for usage.
