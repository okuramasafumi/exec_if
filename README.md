# ExecIf

This gem adds `exec_if` method to `Object` class.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'exec_if'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install exec_if

## Usage

```ruby
require 'exec_if'

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map do |i|
  i.exec_if(i.even?) {|even| 'even' }
end # => [1, 'even', 3, 'even', 5]
```

It is especially useful for long method chains.

```ruby
Item.active.
  exec_if(params[:published_to].presence) {|item, published_to| item.where(published_at: nil..published_to) }.
  exec_if(params[:name].presence) {|item, name| item.where("name LIKE ?", "%#{name}%")}.
  order(published_at: :desc)
```
